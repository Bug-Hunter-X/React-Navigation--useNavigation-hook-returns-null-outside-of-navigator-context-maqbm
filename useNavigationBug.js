This bug occurs when using React Navigation's `useNavigation` hook within a functional component that's not directly rendered by a navigator.  The hook expects to be within a component tree managed by a navigator (like `NavigationContainer`). When this context is missing, `useNavigation` returns null, leading to errors when trying to use navigation methods like `navigate`.  This often manifests as a runtime error or unexpected behavior.
